## GridSound(PC)
This is an open source desktop port of GridSound DAW application which provides you with a complete set of toolkits for music production, editing at avery minimal price and some basic features are available free of cost also.
The project consists of GUI for seamless user experience and consist of various plugins which give industrial effects and make your music ready for the market.
This is made in considersation with the middle class budget who can't afford a very expensive application with minimal cost for extra plugins and high end market features.

DAWs are designed with many user interfaces, but generally, they are based on a multitrack tape recorder metaphor, making it easier for recording engineers and musicians already familiar with using tape recorders to become familiar with the new systems. Therefore, computer-based DAWs tend to have a standard layout that includes transport controls (play, rewind, record, etc.), track controls and a mixer. A waveform display is another common feature.


Plugins:
There are countless software plugins for DAW software, each one coming with its own unique functionality, thus expanding the overall variety of sounds and manipulations that are possible. Each have their own form of generating or manipulating sound, tone, pitch, and speed of a simple sound and transform it into something different. To achieve an even more distinctive sound, multiple plugins can be used in layers, and further automated to manipulate the original sounds.
